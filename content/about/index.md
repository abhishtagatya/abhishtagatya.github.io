My name is Abhishta, I'm currently a Master's Game Development student at Masaryk University. I'm currently making games for many platform: PC, Mobile & Console. I primarily work with Unity & Unreal Engine 5 as a Game Programmer, Technical Artist, or UI Programmer. I love working with Scripts, Shaders, and UI.
